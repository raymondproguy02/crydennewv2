Security Policy
CrydenSync is an authentication library — security issues here can affect real production systems and real users' credentials. Please report responsibly.
Reporting a vulnerability
Do not open a public GitHub issue for a security vulnerability.
Instead, report it privately via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability"), or by emailing the maintainer directly at <devraymond24@gmail.com>.
Please include:
A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
Steps to reproduce, or a minimal proof-of-concept if possible
The version/commit of CrydenSync affected
What to expect
This is currently a solo-maintained open source project — I can't promise enterprise-grade SLAs, but I take security reports seriously and will:
Acknowledge your report as soon as I can, typically within a few days
Investigate and confirm the issue
Work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you before any public write-up
Credit you in the release notes, if you'd like
Please give a reasonable amount of time to fix a confirmed issue before any public disclosure.
Scope
In scope:
The core engine (auth/, token/, session/, security/, store/ — including the Postgres implementation)
Anything that could lead to authentication bypass, token forgery, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or similar
Out of scope:
Vulnerabilities in a consuming application's own code, configuration, or infrastructure (e.g. a leaked JWT_SECRET, a misconfigured database, a consuming app not validating input before passing it to CrydenSync)
Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies — please report those upstream as well, but let me know if CrydenSync needs to update a pinned version in response
The (separate, not-yet-built) CLI, HTTP API, or SDK repositories — report those against the relevant repo once they exist
Supported versions
Only the latest tagged major version receives security fixes. Given this project is early (v2.x), that means the latest v2.x.x release.
Design notes for security reviewers
A few things worth knowing if you're reviewing this codebase:
Refresh tokens are hashed (SHA-256) before storage — the raw token is never persisted
Refresh token rotation includes reuse detection: presenting an already-rotated token revokes the entire session family, not just that token
No default JWT secret exists anywhere — the engine fails construction if one isn't explicitly provided
Account lockout is DB-backed (not in-memory), so it holds across restarts and multiple instances
ChangePassword and DeleteAccount require re-confirmation of the current password, not just a valid access token
